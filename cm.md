### About me
After getting financial education and working as a banker for 14 years I've decided to get a new qualification. It's challenging to move from one side of a whole process (product owner, customer, business analyst) to another (developer), but it's my main goal in the near future. I'm good at working in a team, reviewing big amount of data, making considered decisions. Upper-intermediate level of English skills is enough for comfortable speaking and writing communications. I'm ready to improve and develop.
